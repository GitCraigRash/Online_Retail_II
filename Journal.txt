When predicting how many orders of what will be sold in the coming months, should I generalize the goal? For instance, only ask it how much will sell instead of what country?
Actually, I think a bigger probelm is what is supposed to be the output? Is it a large sheet with the potential orders for the month? A daily prediction? hourly?
Lets go with daily.

I am trying to make a chart that shows how orders fluctuate over time, but it's quite difficult because so many of the countries orders are being shown as zero.
